### Object Oriente Programming

I've reviewed al basic OOP concepts throughout:
|Java| |JavaScript| |Python| |PHP|

```sh
For PHP you must download PHP server
and run it from it.
All this had been performed from Visual Studio Code IDE
```

# Classes

```sh
Classes folder contain within it Cornell method samples
with general information about main concepts.
This might help anyone persuing literacy purpose.

Words folder are set on binary base, Then,
You should open it from Microsoft Word.
